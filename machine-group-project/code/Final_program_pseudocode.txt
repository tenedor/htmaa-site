Final program pseudocode --Ben Garber, 12/8/2015

Main program:
    Load machine persistence stuff
    Hardcoded machine state
        (note: Is there a way to make this modular?  Is it possible to implement a better storage mode for machine descriptions within the Gestalt Node framework?)
    Load GUI (drawing section, xyz0 setting section, sending instructions to machine section.)
    Event loop:
        Allow people to:
            Draw, either in lines or in squiggles (sample for GUI events)
            Jog the machine axes, in order to move to the new x0, y0, z0
            Set zeroes
            Send drawing to machine (function send_instructions_to_machine)
            optionally:
                Save/load machine code/drawing file
        Update GUI

function send_instructions_to_machine(instructions list):
    for each instruction:
        send it
        sample for UI events (probably only pause, cancel, and update status bar)
        delay. (1ms?)
